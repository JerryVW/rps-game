<h2>Summary</h2> 

<p>Building this rock, paper, scissors game brought about some new challenges with manipulating classes to change images and my first time using the switch statement. I also got a taste of trying to get scores to increment and learned a valuable lesson on parameters and arguments when it comes to functions.</p> 

<p>I got more practice on getting things to appear and diappear by manipulating the DOM. Once I got all the functionality working properly I just kept wanting to add new features with changing the messages on the screeen and who was the overall winner when you choose to quite the game.</p>
